## Docker in-depth course
This is ministered by helsinki university, it has valid credits and a certification by finlands government.
Unfortunatelly its closed for now, they keep the whole course updated and a new class will initiate by march 2024.

I will be saving most of the exercises in this repo so I can apply for the cert whenever they return.
For now I will just take the classes and do the exercises just cause I really enjoyed the text book teaching style.
